1. Task-1:
  Problems faced and how were they rectified:
    A. Difficulty in getting used to numpy and other modules - Read the documentations of them to get a better idea.
    B. Faced issues in understanding what actually happens(especially while using multiple parameters) - Watched a few more                         lectures, other than the ones recommended.
  At the end of the task, the concept of gradient descent was clear, and the calculations involving matrices made sense(especially in the Normal equation method)

2. Task-2:
  Couldn't address the accuracy issue in section 2.5(Optional exercises). Will look into it soon.
